# 366FW Discord Members
- You must have all [these](https://github.com/blueberrypi-studio/366FW-Assets/tree/main/Liveries/custom_liveries) skins installed.
- Highly recommended to install all the skins in this Repo. Coffee ☕ Has done an excellent job at making nearly 100 Skins for the Strike Eagle
- New Squadron members can ping Coffee in the discord with their name and callsign, as well as desired squadron and jet. (From 366FW MO Idaho)
